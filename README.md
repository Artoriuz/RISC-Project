# RISC-Project
This repository will be used to document my implementation of a VHDL RISC microprocessor. 
The VHDL code found here will be synthesized on Quartus II 13sp1, and tested on Altera Cyclone II FPGAs.
The ISA doesn't follow all the RISC guidelines, it's incredibly simple and only has some few useful intructions.
