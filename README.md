# RISC-Project
This repository holds an entirely academic VHDL RISC microprocessor project written in VHDL. 
The VHDL code found here was synthesized on Quartus II 13sp1, and tested on Altera Cyclone II FPGAs (DE2 board).
The ISA doesn't necessarily follow all the classic RISC guidelines, it's incredibly simple, limited, straightforward and by design only has some few yet useful intructions. It's not intended to be used in production.
