# RISC-Project
This repository holds an entirely academic VHDL RISC microprocessor project written in VHDL. 
The VHDL code found here will be synthesized on Quartus II 13sp1, and tested on Altera Cyclone II FPGAs.
The ISA doesn't necessarily follow all the classical RISC guidelines, it's incredibly simple, limited, straightforward and only has some few yet useful intructions.
